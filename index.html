      <p>
[=Decentralized Identifiers=] (DIDs) are a type of identifier for verifiable,
decentralized digital identity. These identifiers are designed to enable the
[=controller=] of a DID to prove control over the identifier in a way that is
independent of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.
These sorts of identifiers often utilize a heavy-weight registry, such as ones
utilizing Decentralized Ledger Technologies (DLT), to create, read, update,
and deactivate DIDs. This specification describes a witness-based [=DID
Method=] where each DID Document's history is contained in a cryptographic
event log where each event is witnessed by one or more trusted entities. The
approach avoids the need for complex decentralized consensus algorithms as well
as expensive proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems.

      <h2>did:cel Identifier Syntax</h2>

      <p>
The format for the `did:cel` method conforms to the [[[DID]]] specification and
is simple. It consists of the `did:cel` prefix, followed by a <a
data-cite="CID#Multibase">Multibase</a> base58-btc encoded value
that is a concatenation of the <a data-cite="CID#Multihash">Multihash</a>
identifier and the corresponding cryptographic digest for the initial
cryptographic event log entry.
      </p>

      <p>
The ABNF for the key format is described below:
      </p>

      <pre>
did-cel-format := did:cel:&lt;mb-value>
mb-value       := z[a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]+
      </pre>

      <p>
Alternatively, the encoding rules can also be thought of as the application
of a series of transformation functions on the raw public key bytes:
      </p>

      <tt>
did-cel-identifier := did:cel:MULTIBASE(base58-btc, MULTICODEC(sha3-256, JCS(initial-event-log-entry)))
      </tt>

      <p>
A simple example of a valid `did:cel` DID is:
